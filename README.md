# Weather App

Tiny and simple Nodejs TypeScript command line tool for weather app.

## Getting Started

This app is a Nodejs TypeScript version of *Andrew Mead's* Nodejs ES6 WeatherApp.

On this version it enhances the back-end architecture, once it takes OOP architecture along side TypeScript and ES6 and 7 features, this project is taking the great advantage of working with TypeScript on the back-end with Nodejs.  

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Nodejs, NPM, TypeScript, GitBash or Linux command line interface, VSCode or your preferred Code Editor - Latest 
```

### Building process

It's an example object you should have in order to make the sensitive information hidden over the `.gitkeep` repository, *environments*.

```
 module.exports = {
     googleAPIURL: 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/',
     googleAPIKey: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXk',
     forecastIOURL: 'https://api.darksky.net/forecast/',
     forecastIOKey: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
 }
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
npm run init-project
```
